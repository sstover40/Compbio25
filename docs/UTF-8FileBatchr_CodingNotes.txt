Project Outline:

- Create toy files
- Read in individual csv
- Write code to process csv
- Create output in a list
- Create summary df
- Add columns for ID, filename, nrows
- Create summary plot
- Transfer list to a line of the summary plot

Need to open files with list.files()
- May need regular expressions to get *.csv

Global variables
- Vector of file names with paths
- basenames()
  - basenames strips out the path statement
- Vectors of numbers pointing to columns in the .csv
  - which columns in the .csv do we need to point to?
